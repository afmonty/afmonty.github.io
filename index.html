              <span class = "desc">About: This application allows student type users to submit videos to schools in consideration for their various programs (eg. arts, sports). I completed this in 14 days using React with Backbone collections and models.  I am also using a PostgrSQL database with KNEX and bookshelf.</span>
              <span class = "likes">Likes: Completing my project, or at least completing version 1 gave me a profound sense of accomplishment.  I learned a lot, fast. I created this after 2 months of coding.  I really enjoyed the backend routing and database work.</span>
              <span class="dislikes">Challenges: I found styling most challenging and frustrating.</span>

              <span class = "desc">About: I initially created this using multiple click event listeners which repeated A Lot of code.  I did it over one weekend on day 18 of my front-end learnng journey.  I created a large collection and used JQuery.</span>
              <span class = "likes">Likes:  I LOVE this project because it marks the point of understanding for me.  I knew when I looked at the challenge that I could accomplish it. And on day 25, I created this DRY version!</span>
              <span class="dislikes">Challenges: Styling will alway be a challenge, but from a code standpoint, it was finding a way to write it more efficiently.</span>
